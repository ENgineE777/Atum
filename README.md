# Atum

Atum is another one game engine. But engine with has already full workable editor. Key feature of engine is that glue code
beetwen editor code and game code minimized. Code have very simple ideas behind architecture. Also amount of code minimized
as much of possible. I hope this have minimum effect to perfomance.

Currentle engine consist from:

- Render system bassed on DX11 but creatated as multi API so adding support of another GAPI is planed
- Controls system bassed on aliases
- Powerfull system for bindidng properties into editor
- Scene Editor with ability to run edited scene
- Font system based on stb_truetype.h
- Support of PhysX 3.0, in repo there are samples that uses physics
- Network code that alow create server/clinet, in repo there some code allow to create simple network game

I planning to use this engine in multiplayer game so I defenitly will evolve engine. Also adding support of mobile
devices is planned.
