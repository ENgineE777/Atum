\section overview_why Why

Atum engine is a open source game engine distributed via zlib license. Most of game engines have focus
on render techniques. The main target of Atum is to deliver the best toolset and I hope, Atum will be
a good light weighted alternative to Unity and Unreal Engine for indie games. Atum has a fully workable
editor with heavy usage of assets and also has an ability to play test edited scene. All system code has
simple ideas behind them and focused on easy to use functionality.
