Atum engine is a newcomer in a row of game engines. Most game engines focus on render
techniques in features list. The main task of Atum is to deliver the best toolset, that’s why,
as I hope, Atum will be a good light weighted alternative to Unity for indie games. Atum already
has fully workable editor that has an ability to play test edited scene. All system code has
simple ideas behind them and focuses on easy to use functionality. That’s why code is minimized
as much as possible.
