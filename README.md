Atum engine is a newcomer in a row of game engines. Most game engines focus on render
techniques in features list. The main task of Atum is to deliver the best toolset, that’s why,
as I hope, Atum will be a good light weighted alternative to Unity for indie games. Atum already
has fully workable editor that has an ability to play test edited scene. All system code has
simple ideas behind them and focuses on easy to use functionality. That’s why code is minimized
as much as possible.

Currently the engine have follow features:

- PC, Android and iOS platforms are supported
- Scene Editor with ability to play test edited scene
- Powerful system for binding properties into the editor
- Powerful assets system
- Track based editor for creation of animated objects
- Sprite Editor
- Render system that supports DX11 and OpenGL
- UI system bassed on assets
- Script system based on angel script
- Controls system based on aliases
- Font system based on stb_truetype.h
- Support of PhysX 3.0, there are samples in repo that's using physics
- Network code which allows to create server/clinet; there is some code in repo which allows
  to create a simple network game
